- 👋 Hi, I’m @therealsarahp
- 👀 I’m interested in continuning my education following LaunchCode's bootcamp and building things that are 
    accessible and increase communicaiton and connection
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can! Working with JavaScript and Java as my primary languages to access 
     the wide world of tech. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I want to find (or make!) a project that meshes the worlds I've come from-- art, 
     food, language, sustainability, people and brings them to more people through accessible technology.
